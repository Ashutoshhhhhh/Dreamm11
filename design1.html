<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Dream11 was co-founded by Harsh Jain (son of Indian businessman Anand Jain) and Bhavit Sheth in 2008.[10][11][12][13] In 2012, they introduced freemium fantasy sports in India for cricket fans.[13] In 2014, the company reported 1 million registered users, which grew to 2 million in 2016 and to 45 million in 2018.[14][15] In April 2019, Steadview Capital completed secondary investment in Dream11. Apart from Steadview, Dream11's investors included Kalaari Capital, Think Investments,[16] Multiples Equity and Tencent.[9] In April 2019, they launched FanCode, an ad-free multi-sport aggregator platform offering content, commerce and community engagement.[17] In 2021, Dream 11's parent company, Dream Sports raised $840 million in a funding round led by Tiger Global, D1 Capital, Falcon Edge, DST Global, and Redbird Capital.[18]</h3>

<h1>Legality</h1>
<h3>In 2017, a case was registered against the company in an Indian High Court. The court, in its ruling, stated that playing the Dream11 game involves superior knowledge, judgement and attention. The Court also held that "the element of skill" had a predominant influence on the outcome of the Dream11 game. However, the law does not allow fantasy sports in a few Indian states like Assam, Odisha, Telangana[19] and Andhra Pradesh.[20] A challenge to this judgement was filed with the Supreme Court of India, which dismissed the appeal.[21] The judgement provided legality[22] to the company and allowed them to run their operations throughout the country.[23]

    Despite it being adjudged to be a "game of skill", experts believe that the company operates in the country's regulatory "grey area".[24][25]</h3>
